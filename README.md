## Installation

Intercom for iOS supports iOS 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 & 13. 

### CocoaPods
Add the Intercom pod into your Podfile and run `pod install`.
```ruby
    target :YourTargetName do
      pod 'Intercom'
    end
```
### Carthage
1. Add `github "intercom/intercom-ios"` to your Cartfile.
2. Run carthage update.
3. Go to your Xcode project's "General" settings. Drag `Intercom.framework` from `Carthage/Build/iOS` to the "Embedded Binaries" section. Make sure ‚ÄúCopy items if needed‚Äù is selected and click Finish.

### Manual Installation

1. [Download Intercom for iOS](https://github.com/intercom/intercom-ios/archive/master.zip) and extract the zip.
2. Go to your Xcode project's "General" settings. Drag `Intercom.framework` to the "Embedded Binaries" section. Make sure "Copy items if needed" is selected and click Finish.
3. Create a new "Run Script Phase" in your app‚Äôs target‚Äôs "Build Phases" and paste the following snippet in the script text field:

        bash "${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH}/Intercom.framework/strip-frameworks.sh"
This step is required to work around an [App Store submission bug](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=6409498411401216) when archiving universal binaries.

## Update Info.plist

When installing Intercom, you'll need to make sure that you have a `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` entry in your `Info.plist`.

This is [required by Apple](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1937/_index.html) for all apps that access the photo library. It is necessary when installing Intercom due to the image upload functionality. Users will be prompted for the photo library permission only when they tap the image upload button.

## Example app
There is an example app provided [here](https://github.com/intercom/intercom-ios/tree/master/Examples) for both Objective-C and Swift.
