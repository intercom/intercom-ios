/**
 Intercom is your direct line of communication to every user, right inside your app. Intercomâ€™s in-app messages
 are up to 10 times more effective than email too! Send the right messages, to the right users, at exactly the right time.

 ## How do I track my users?

 In order to see your users in Intercom's user list, you must first register them via your iOS application. If you have a
 place in your application where you become aware of the user's identity such as a log in view controller, call one of the
 following depending on the information you have available for that user:

 If you have both a unique user identifier and an email for your users::

 [Intercom registerUserWithUserId:@"123456" email:@"joe@example.com"];

 If you only have a unique identifier for your users:

 [Intercom registerUserWithUserId:@"123456"];

 Finally, if you only have an email address for your users:

 [Intercom registerUserWithEmail:@"joe@example.com"];

 ## Can I track unidentified users?

 Yes, absolutely. If you have an application that doesn't require users to log in, you can call:

 [Intercom registerUnidentifiedUser];

 If the user subsequently logs in or you learn additional information about them (e.g. get an email address),
 calling any of the other user registration methods will update that user's identity in Intercom and contain
 all user data tracked previously.

 ## How do push notifications work?

 Intercom for iOS enables your users to receive push notifications for new messages. Simply call:

 - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken {
     [Intercom setDeviceToken:deviceToken];
 }

 in your `didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:` method once you have registered your app for
 push notifications with the `UIApplicationDelegate`.

 When your app receives a push notification Intercom for iOS checks to see if it is an Intercom push notification
 and opens the message. You do not need to implement any additional code in order to launch the message window.

 To do this we [safely swizzle](http://blog.newrelic.com/2014/04/16/right-way-to-swizzle/) the public methods
 in `UIApplicationDelegate` that handle receiving push notifications. We do not use any private APIs to do this.

 us directly via Intercom for any support or questions you may have.

 Initialize Intercom with your iOS API key and App ID.  This will allow your app to connect with Intercom.
 This is best done in the application delegate's didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method.

//=========================================================================================================
/*!
 Secure Mode helps to make sure that conversations between you and your users are kept private, and that one
 user can't impersonate another. In Secure Mode Intercom for iOS will sign all requests going to the Intercom servers
 with tokens. It requires your mobile application to have its own server which authenticates the app's users,
 and which can store a secret. More information on secure mode can be found [here](http://docs.intercom.io/Install-on-your-mobile-product/enabling-secure-mode-in-intercom-for-ios )

 If you call registerUnidentifiedUser, all activity will be tracked anonymously. If you choose to subsequently
 identify that user, all that anonymous activity will be merged into the identified user. This means that you
 will no longer see the anonymous user in Intercom, but rather the identified one.

 We recommend this is called from within the application delegate's didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method.

 @note You must call one of the user registration methods in order to start communicating with Intercom.

 In order to keep track of a specific user, you must identify it with a unique user identifier, an email
 address, or both. By supplying information like this Intercom provides richer user profiles for your users.
 This is a userId, supplied by you (e.g. from an existing web service for your product) to represent your
 user in Intercom, once set it cannot be changed.

 If you are putting Intercom for iOS into an app that has persisted an authentication token or equivalent
 so your users don't have to log in repeatedly (like most apps) then we advise putting the user registration
 call in the `didBecomeActive:` method in your application delegate. This won't have any negative impact if
 you also add it to your authentication success method elsewhere in your app.

 @param userId  A unique identifier for your user.
 @param email   Your user's email address.

//=========================================================================================================
/** @name Updating the user */
//=========================================================================================================
/*!
 You can send any data you like to Intercom. Typically our customers see a lot of value in sending data that
 relates to customer development, such as price plan, value of purchases, etc. Once these have been sent to
 Intercom you can then apply filters based on these attributes.

 A detailed list of the fields you can use to [update a user is available here](https://developers.intercom.com/reference/#user-model )

 Attributes such as the user email or name can be updated by calling

 [Intercom updateUserWithAttributes:@{
 @"email" : @"admin@intercom.io",
 @"name" : @"Admin Name"
 }];

 Custom user attributes can be created and modified by passing a custom_attributes dictionary
 You do not have to create attributes in Intercom beforehand. If one hasn't been seen before, it will be
 created for you automatically.

 [Intercom updateUserWithAttributes:@{
 @"custom_attributes": @{
 @"paid_subscriber" : @YES,
 @"monthly_spend": @155.5,
 @"team_mates": @3
 }
 }];

 You can also set company data via this call by submitting an attribute dictionary like

 [Intercom updateUserWithAttributes:@{
 @"companies": @[ @{
 @"name" : @"My Company",
 @"id" : @"abcd1234"
 }
 ]}];

 id is a required field for adding or modifying a company. A detailed description of the
 [company model is available here](https://developers.intercom.com/reference/#companies )

 @note Attributes may be either a `string`, `integer`, `double`, `unix timestamp` or `bool`.

/*!
 Log an event with a given name.

 You can log events in Intercom based on user actions in your app. Events are different
 to custom user attributes in that events are information on what Users did and when they
 did it, whereas custom user attributes represent the User's current state as seen in their
 profile. See details about Events [here](https://developers.intercom.com/reference/#events )

 @param name The name of the event that it is going to be logged.

 fired accordingly when the Intercom Notification (chat head) is presented.

 Once the user taps on the chat head, the message is presented in your app. It will be presented covering
 the entire screen, but no notifications will be thrown here as Intercom has already been visible.

 In the case of a new conversation this notification may be used to prompt users to enable push notifications.
