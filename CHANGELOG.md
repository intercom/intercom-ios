## 5.4.0
###### Release Date: 09-07-2019

### New Feature 🤖

## Handle new conversations with Custom Bots to provide faster, more personal support at scale.

Adding a bot to your inbound conversations enables your customers to self serve, and gives you a way to automatically collect some basic information about what your customers need, which otherwise your team would have to collect manually.
